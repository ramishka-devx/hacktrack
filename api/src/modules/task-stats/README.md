## Task Status Values

The system tracks the following task statuses:

- **`assigned`**: Task has been assigned but not started
- **`in_progress`**: User is currently working on the task
- **`submitted`**: User has submitted the task for review
- **`reviewed`**: Task has been reviewed by mentors/organizers
- **`closed`**: Task is complete and closed

## Completion Status Mapping

- **`not_assigned`**: Task exists but not assigned to user
- **`not_started`**: Task assigned but work hasn't begun (`assigned`)
- **`in_progress`**: User is actively working (`in_progress`)
- **`completed`**: Task is finished (`submitted`, `reviewed`, or `closed`)

## Statistics Calculations

### Completion Percentage
```
(Completed Tasks / Total Assigned Tasks) Ã— 100
```

### Total Points
Sum of points from all completed tasks (status: `submitted`, `reviewed`, or `closed`)

### Average Score
Average of all scores from completed tasks where score is not null

## Error Responses

### 404 Not Found
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Contest not found"
}
```

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "User not found or not participating in this contest"
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized
```json
{

```

## Sample Use Cases

### 1. Contest Dashboard
```javascript
// Get overall contest metrics
GET /api/contests/1/stats/overall

// Get task completion breakdown
GET /api/contests/1/stats/tasks

// Get top performers
GET /api/contests/1/stats/leaderboard?limit=5
```

### 2. User Progress Tracking
```javascript
// Get user's current progress
GET /api/contests/1/stats/my-tasks

// Get user's summary statistics
GET /api/contests/1/stats/my-stats
```

### 3. Administrative Monitoring
```javascript
// Monitor specific user progress
GET /api/contests/1/stats/users/123/tasks

// Get detailed user analytics
GET /api/contests/1/stats/users/123/stats
```

## Database Dependencies

This module relies on the following tables:
- `contests` - Contest information
- `task` - Task definitions
- `users` - User information  
- `user_task` - Task assignments and completion status

## Performance Considerations

- Queries use appropriate indexes on `contest_id`, `user_id`, and `task_id`
- Leaderboard queries are optimized with pagination
- Statistics are calculated in real-time (consider caching for high-traffic scenarios)
- Complex aggregations may benefit from database views or materialized tables

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time statistics updates via WebSockets
- Caching layer for frequently accessed statistics
- Historical trend analysis
- Export functionality for reports
- Custom date range filtering
- Performance analytics and insights
